  {
    question: "1. Can a traditional Ayurveda formulation be patented?",
    answer:
      "Traditional knowledge that is already publicly known generally cannot be patented as a new invention. However, a genuinely novel and inventive modification or application may require separate patentability assessment.",
  },
  {
    question: "2. What is TKDL?",
    answer:
      "The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) documents traditional Indian knowledge in a structured format. It helps prevent wrongful patent claims over knowledge that already exists in traditional sources.",
  },
  {
    question: "3. What is Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS)?",
    answer:
      "ABS refers to sharing benefits arising from the use of biological resources and associated traditional knowledge with the relevant providers or communities, according to applicable legal frameworks.",
  },
  {
    question: "4. What is Section 3(p) of the Patents Act, 1970?",
    answer:
      "Section 3(p) addresses inventions that are essentially traditional knowledge or an aggregation/duplication of known properties of traditionally known components, making them non-patentable under that provision.",
  },
  {
    question: "5. How can I determine whether my Ayurveda formulation is classical or proprietary?",
    answer:
      "You should check whether it comes from a recognized classical source and whether its ingredients, proportions, preparation method, route, or intended use have been substantially modified.",
  },
];

const ayushFaqsRight = [
  {
    question: "6. What if I modify a classical Ayurveda formulation?",
    answer:
      "A modification does not automatically make it patentable. Novelty, inventive contribution, evidence, and the applicable regulatory/IP framework must be assessed.",
  },
  {
    question: "7. What is the difference between IP protection and regulatory approval?",
    answer:
      "IP protection concerns rights such as patents, trademarks, and geographical indications. Regulatory approval concerns whether a product can legally be manufactured, marketed, or used for a particular purpose.",
  },
  {
    question: "8. Does international IP protection automatically apply in other countries?",
    answer:
      "No. Intellectual-property rights are generally territorial. Protection and requirements can differ between countries, although international agreements such as TRIPS establish certain common standards.",
  },
  {
    question: "9. What is the Nagoya Protocol?",
    answer:
      "The Nagoya Protocol is an international framework concerning access to genetic resources and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization.",
  },
  {
    question: "10. Can IP-SAKTI Sahayak provide legal advice?",
    answer:
      "No. IP-SAKTI Sahayak provides educational guidance based on its available sources. Its responses should not be treated as professional legal advice.",
  },
